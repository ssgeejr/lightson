Simple UI game in which the users turns all of the lights (cells) to the on state. Each click XOR's (switches) the clicked cell, the one to the left and right and the the ones above and below on/off. Once all the cells are -ON- the game is completed.

The concept isn't new, the game isn't new and it's not even web-based :(   But my kids wanted "daddy" to write them a game to play on the computer so this was the best ~quick-and-easy~ I could come up with in such a short time.

LightsOn is a simple logic games that allows one to turn all the squares "on".  When you turn one light on/off the blocks above, below, left and right all change colors as well.

Presently I only have 6 levels build but a buddy of mine wrote a brute force cracker for the game and we're going to drop about 50 levels on the game in the near future.

I hope you enjoy it.
